I'm <b>Felipe Victorino Caputo</b>, a Computer Science MS graduate from Rochester Institute of Technology, with an emphasis in Computer Graphics. And you, here you are on my little blog where I'll post and discuss a few pet projects that I have been working on. So buckle up, things are about to become graphic (get it?).
