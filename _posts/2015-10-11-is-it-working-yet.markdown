Hey, so this is a post. The first post of this blog actually, as you can see.

Took me a bit of time to get everything working like I wanted to. Jekyll made everything really easy, and changing some configurations to make the site look liked I wanted to wasn't hard. In the end things worked out alright.

So now the blog is up and running. Here I'll be posting about some of my pet projects, which the majority will be most likely related to computer graphics because that's my jam. But you never know.

Stick around, I'll be making some posts whenever I got the time. :)
